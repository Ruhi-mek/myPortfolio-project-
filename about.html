        <!--This section contains two parts: <main> and <aside>. 
            Since only HTML is used, both parts will appear vertically one after the other. 
            The <main> part includes all the paragraphs (About Me, quotes, etc.).

                I'm Ruhama Mekonen, a 2nd year Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia. I am a beginner frontend developer,<span>I work with passion and dedication beyond the beginner level</span>. I have experience with Python and HTML, having practiced them for over two years. Although my journey was not always consistent, I am now fully committed to growing as a developer without distractions.
            </p>
            <p>
               You might wonder how I plan to become a great frontend developer without yet mastering CSS and JavaScript. Don't worry, I am actively learning both, and I believe in the power of small steps. As the saying goes:
                <em>“Appreciate small lessons today; they build great wisdom tomorrow.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see in the picture, I come from a large and supportive family. Growing up in this environment taught me how to understand different ways of thinking and appreciate diverse perspectives. This experience has shaped the way I approach programming and teamwork. As Martin Fowler once said:
                <blockquote>
                    “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”
                </blockquote>
                My background helps me write code that is not only functional but also clear and meaningful for people. Trust me, my progress will be unbelievable, and you can follow along through my projects.
